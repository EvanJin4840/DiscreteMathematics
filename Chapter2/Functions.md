* Relations
- The most common name for a subset of a Cartesian product is a relation. In discrete mathematics, a relation from A to B is formally defined as a subset of A×B. It's a way of specifying a connection or relationship between elements of two sets.
+ For example, if A is a set of people and B is a set of activities, a relation could be "the set of people who like a specific activity."
R={(Alice,swimming),(Bob,hiking)}
This relation is a subset of the Cartesian product of all people and all activities.

* Range(치역)
- the range of f is the set of all possible output values (images) of f when you substitute every element from set A into the function.
Range (also called image): The set of all actual output values the function produces when applied to every element of the domain. The range is a subset of the codomain—only the values that the function really outputs.

* Codomain
- The set of all possible output values that the function is allowed to have by definition. It includes all values that the function could produce, whether or not they actually appear as outputs. The codomain is part of the definition of the function.


#### Injection 

injection is a type of function where every element of the codomain has at most one element of the domain mapped to it.
In simpler terms, an injection is a function where no two distinct elements of the domain map to the same element in the codomain.
* Key Characteristics
One-to-one mapping: Each input value from the domain is mapped to a unique output value in the codomain.
No shared outputs: No two different inputs can produce the same output.
The term "injection" is synonymous with "one-to-one function."

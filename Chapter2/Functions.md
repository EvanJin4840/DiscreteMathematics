* Relations
- The most common name for a subset of a Cartesian product is a relation. In discrete mathematics, a relation from A to B is formally defined as a subset of A×B. It's a way of specifying a connection or relationship between elements of two sets.
+ For example, if A is a set of people and B is a set of activities, a relation could be "the set of people who like a specific activity."
R={(Alice,swimming),(Bob,hiking)}
This relation is a subset of the Cartesian product of all people and all activities.

* Range(치역)
- the range of f is the set of all possible output values (images) of f when you substitute every element from set A into the function.
Range (also called image): The set of all actual output values the function produces when applied to every element of the domain. The range is a subset of the codomain—only the values that the function really outputs.

* Codomain
- The set of all possible output values that the function is allowed to have by definition. It includes all values that the function could produce, whether or not they actually appear as outputs. The codomain is part of the definition of the function.

* Cardinality (원소의 개수 또는 크기)
- there are three different cardinality, countable, uncoutable, countably infinite
- even if it is inifinite, sometimes it can be countable in one to one correspondance ??
- don't think too much zinifinite number just accept it

#### Injection 

injection is a type of function where every element of the codomain has at most one element of the domain mapped to it.
In simpler terms, an injection is a function where no two distinct elements of the domain map to the same element in the codomain.
* Key Characteristics
One-to-one mapping: Each input value from the domain is mapped to a unique output value in the codomain.
No shared outputs: No two different inputs can produce the same output.
The term "injection" is synonymous with "one-to-one function."


#### Surjections (onto function)

A function is a surjection if every possible output is actually reached.
- Simple Rule: Nothing in the destination set is left out.
- Analogy: If you are assigning people to chairs, a surjection means there are no empty chairs.

#### Bijections (one-to-one correspondence)

A function is a bijection if it creates a perfect, one-to-one pairing between two sets.
- It must follow two rules at once:
1. Injective: No two inputs go to the same output (no sharing).
2. Surjective: Every output is reached (no one left out).

- Simple Rule: It's a perfect match.
- Why it's important: It proves that two sets have the exact same number of elements.

#### Composition

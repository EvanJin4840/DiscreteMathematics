## Set (Naive set theory)

### Terms

* Rational Numbers (Q) : A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, p/q, where p is an integer and q is a non-zero integer. (유리수)
* Irrational Numbers (무리수) : Irrational numbers are "not-ratio-nal" because they can't be expressed this way. Their decimals, like 3.14159265... or 1.41421356..., go on forever with no end and no repeating sequence.
* Real Numbers (R) : A real number is any number that can be found on a continuous number line. This includes all rational numbers, as well as irrational numbers, which cannot be expressed as a simple fraction.
* Complex Numbers (C) : A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a+bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit, defined as i^2=−1. (복소수)
- a is called the real part. (실수 부분)
- b is called the imaginary part. (허수 부분)

## Set operations

* Intersection
- the intersection of sets A and B {x|x E A ^ x E B}
- If the intersection is empty, then A and B are said to be disjoint.

## Set (Naive set theory)

### Terms

* Rational Numbers (Q) : A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, p/q, where p is an integer and q is a non-zero integer. (유리수)
* Irrational Numbers (무리수) : Irrational numbers are "not-ratio-nal" because they can't be expressed this way. Their decimals, like 3.14159265... or 1.41421356..., go on forever with no end and no repeating sequence.
* Real Numbers (R) : A real number is any number that can be found on a continuous number line. This includes all rational numbers, as well as irrational numbers, which cannot be expressed as a simple fraction.
* Complex Numbers (C) : A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a+bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit, defined as i^2=−1. (복소수)
- a is called the real part. (실수 부분)
- b is called the imaginary part. (허수 부분)

* Membership Tables
- A membership table (or truth table for sets) is a table that shows whether an element is a member of a given set expression. It uses 1 to represent "is a member" and 0 to represent "is not a member." It is a visual and systematic way to check if two set expressions are equivalent.

## Set operations

* Intersection
- the intersection of sets A and B {x|x E A ^ x E B}
- If the intersection is empty, then A and B are said to be disjoint (서로소).

* Symmetric Difference
- The Symmetric Difference of A and B, denoted by A (exclusive or symbol) B is the set (A-B) U (B-A)

### Important Sets
N = natural numbers = {0,1,2,3...} (or {1,2,3,...})
Z = integers = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
Z+ = positive integers = {1, 2, 3, ...}
R = set of real numbers
R+ = set of positive real numbers
C = set of complex numbers.
Q = set of rational numbers.

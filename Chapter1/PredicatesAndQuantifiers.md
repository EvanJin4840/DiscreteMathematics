### terms
- predicates :  a predicate is a statement that contains variables. It's not a proposition on its own because its truth value depends on the values assigned to its variables. Once the variables are assigned specific values or are quantified, the predicate becomes a proposition with a definite truth value (either true or false).

- quantifiers : Quantifiers are symbols that specify the number of elements in a domain that a predicate holds for. They are used to turn predicates into propositions. The two most common quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier.

- An n-ary predicate : a predicate with n variables. The term "ary" is a suffix used in mathematics and logic to indicate the number of arguments, or variables, an operation or a predicate takes.

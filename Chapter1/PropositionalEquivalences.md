### Tautology
- a proposition which is always true.
### Contradiction
- a proposition which is always false.
### contingency
- a proposition which is neither a tautology nor a contradiction.

## Logically Equivalent
* If p<->q is tautology, two compound propositions p and q are logically equivalent.
- (p->q)^(q->p) is always true when "p and q have the same truth value" .

## Note
- p→q is always true when q is false only if p is also false. This is because a conditional statement is only false when the hypothesis (p) is true and the conclusion (q) is false. In all other cases, it's considered true to avoid a logical contradiction.

### terms
- Conjunction is a logical operator that combines two propositions with the word "and." It is denoted by the symbol ∧. The compound proposition p∧q is only true when both p and q are true. Otherwise, it is false.
- Disjunction is a logical operator that combines two propositions with the word "or." It is denoted by the symbol ∨. The compound proposition p∨q is true if at least one of the propositions, p or q, is true. It is only false when both p and q are false.

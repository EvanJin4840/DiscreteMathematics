### Terms
* experiment : a procedure that yields one of a given set of possible outcomes.
* sample space : the sample sapace of the expreiment is the set of possible outcomes.
* event : a subset of the sample space.

#### Definition of probability of the event by Laplace
* Definition : If S is finite sample space of equally likely outcomes, and E is an event, that is, a subset of S, then the probability of E is p(E) = |E|/|S|.
- For every event E, we have 0 <= p(E) <= 1. This follows directly from the definition because 0 <= p(E) = |E|/|S| <= |S|/|S| <= 1, since 0 <= |E| <= |S|.

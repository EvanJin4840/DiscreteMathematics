## Definition

A graph G = (V, E) consists of nonempty set V of vertices(or nodes) and a set E of edges(could be an empty).
Each edge has either one or two vertices associated with it, called endpoints
An edge is said to connect its endpoints.

- Simple graph: each edge connnects two diffrerent vertices and no two edges connect the same pair of vertices.
- Multigraph: may have multiple edges conecting the same two vertices
- Pseudograph: may include loops, as well as multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices.

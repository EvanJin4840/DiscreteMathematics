## Definition about relation

1. Let A and B be sets. A binary relation from A to B is subset of AXB.
2. A relation on a set A is a relation from A to A.
3. A relation R on a set A is called reflexive if (a,a)is a element of R for every element a is a element of A
4. A relation R on a set A is called symmetric if (b,a) is a element of R whenever (a,b) is a element of R, for all a, b are element of A.
   A relation R on a set A such that for all a,b is element of R and (b,a) is element of R, then a = b is called antisymmetric.

## Definition about relation

1. Let A and B be sets. A binary relation from A to B is subset of AXB.
2. A relation on a set A is a relation from A to A.
3. A relation R on a set A is called reflexive if (a,a)is a element of R for every element a is a element of A
4. A relation R on a set A is called symmetric if (b,a) is a element of R whenever (a,b) is a element of R, for all a, b are element of A.
   A relation R on a set A such that for all a,b is element of R and (b,a) is element of R, then a = b is called antisymmetric.

#### Summary

1. Symmetric (대칭 관계)

- If element a is related to b, then b must also be related to a, It represents a mutual relationship
- Something like, handshake, friend realtionship, etc..

2. Antisymmetric (반대칭 관계)

- If a relates to b and b relates to a, then a and b must be identical.
- Mutual relationships between distinct elements are forbidden
- But (a->a) is allowed
